# Why choose whatstk?

There are many python libraries to deal with WhatsApp and other platform chat files. Why should you choose **whatstk** over these?

## Automatic parser

In WhatsApp, the chat might be exported in [different formats](getting_started/hformat.md) depending on your phone configuration, which adds complexity when parsing the chat. **whatstk** incorporates a reliable and powerful parser to correctly infer the structure of most of the chats. In the rare and improbable case that the automatic parser does not work for a certain chat, you can still use `hformat`.

## The power of pandas and plotly

**whatstk** uses well established and mantained python libraries [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) to process the data and [plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) and exploits their potential to efficiently process and create figures.
